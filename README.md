# ES215-Computer-Organization-and-Architecture-Group-Project
This repository contains the source files for the ES215 Course Project. We built an MIPS Assembler and Disassembler Program in Python as part of this project. We also built a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for this program using Python's Tkinter library. The team consisted of Bhavesh Jain, Rahul Chembakasseril, Dhruv Parekh and myself.


## How to Test?
1. The attached report contains the Data Card/instructions our program supports. 
2. The GUI will open a textbox for both- the Assembler and the Disassembler.
3. To use the Assembler, write any program (in the supported instructions)- line by line- in the input textbox and press Convert to obtain the Machine Code.
4. To use the Disassembler, type in the Machine Code- line by line- in the input textbox and press Convert to obtain the MIPS Code.
