# ES215-Computer-Organization-and-Architecture-Group-Project
This repository contains the source files for the ES215 Course Project. As part of this project, we built a MIPS Assembler and Disassembler Program in Python. We also built a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for this program using Python's Tkinter library. The team consisted of Bhavesh Jain, Chirag Sarda, Dhruv Parekh and myself.


How to Test?

1.The attached report contains the Data Card/instructions supported by our program. 

2.The GUI will open a textbox for both- the Assembler and the Disassembler.

3.To use the Assembler, simply write any program (in the supported instructions)- line by line- in the input textbox and press Convert to obtain the Machine Code.

4.To use the Disassembler, type in the Machine Code- line by line- in the input textbox and press Convert to obtain the MIPS Code.
